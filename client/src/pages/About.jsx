        founded in 2014, based in Huittinen, Finland. We specialize in offering
        personal services that are tailored to meet the unique needs of our
        clients. As a customer-oriented company, we are committed to delivering
        reliable and high-quality service solutions across various areas not
        classified elsewhere. One of our flagship offerings is an innovative
        mobile game called Farm Faults. This game blends the thrill of gaming
        with the excitement of outdoor exploration. Inspired by the success of
        augmented reality games like Pok√©mon Go, Farm Faults encourages players
        to step outside, explore their surroundings, and solve engaging
        challenges in a farming-themed world. The game promotes strategic
        thinking, problem-solving, and adventure, all while having fun. Our
        mission is to provide enjoyable and memorable experiences that bring
        people closer to nature and foster a spirit of discovery. With a passion
        for innovation and a commitment to excellence, we continuously strive to
